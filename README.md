This script will send a random irish word to the users selcected email address with the translation and a link to a website that can be used to listen to the pronounciation of the word.
The email is stylised using HTML and CSS to make it more attractive when viewing. 

To make this script run everyday you can use an online cloud server such as python anywhere to run the script at a certain time everyday. Doing so the script will send a random word at the desired time. 
Python anywhere allows you to run one script for free.
I have not programmed the code to stop it from repeating a word again as i wanted to allow it to repeat words for the sack of revision. 
A feature i may implement in the future would be to have all the words of the week store and then sent again in a recap email at the end of the week.
